# üó®Ô∏è deliberat.io

deliberat.io aims to be a platform for sharing arguments, connecting them with each other and analyzing their functions, types and structure. Goals are to train argumentative skills and knowledge on the one hand while deepening the understanding for different opinions and life realities of other people on the other hand.

Currently, we are working on the concept by filling the documentation-style website over at deliberatio with ideas about the general structure as well as thoughts about strategies.
